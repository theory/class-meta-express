Revision history for Perl extension Class::Meta::Express.

0.14  2023-08-02T01:26:30Z
      - Better fix for failing tests on Windows, suggested by Eric Brine.
      - Fixed broken rt.cpan.org email address.
      - Fixed a couple of typos in the Pod. Thanks to Grzegorz Ro≈ºniecki for
        the pull request (#1).
      - Fixed no-op version requirement for Class::Meta thanks to Graham Knop
        (#2).

0.13  2011-06-20T23:09:39
      - Removed redundant bug reporting email address from the documentation.
      - Fixed failing test on Perl 5.14 on Win32.

0.12  2011-06-20T00:50:10
      - Moved repository to
        [GitHub](https://github.com/theory/class-meta-express/).
      - Switched to a "traditional" `Makefile.PL`.

0.11  2008-05-22T03:17:58
      - Removed the spelling test from the distribution, since it can fail on
        systems without a spell program or using a different locale.
      - Fixed test failures on Perl 5.6.
      - Added Module::Build to the `build_requires` parameter in Build.PL.

0.10  2008-05-13T03:45:58
      - Added a link to the Subversion repository.
      - Updated the documentation so that all examples use `class`
        rather than the deprecated `build`.
      - Calling the `meta` function is now optional. If it is not called,
        Class::Meta::Express will create a key name from the last part of the
        class name. Suggested by Jon Swartz.
      - Moved the justification for creating this module towards the end of
        the documentation, so that the important description of how to use it
        is more prominently towards the top. Suggested by Jon Swartz.
      - Added brief descriptions of the parameters supported by Class::Meta
        for each function.
      - Added tests to ensure that the `view` parameter is properly respected.
      - Now requiring Class::Meta 0.60 or later to take advantage of its
        integrated `default_type` parameter.
      - The `reexport` parameter now respects many of the other parameters
        passed to `meta`, not just `meta_class` and `default_type`.
      - Added a spelling test. This has the benefit of reducing the number of
        annoying spelling errors in the documentation.

0.05  2008-05-02T02:15:26
      - Added the "configure_requires", and "recommends" parameters to
        Build.PL.
      - Fixed for Perl 5.6.2.

0.04  2006-08-19T02:31:49
      - Fixed bad example of splicing @_ in the "Overriding Functions"
        documentation.
      - Added the 'class' keyword to make class declarations more natural--
        that is, without needing to call the 'build' function.
      - Deprecated the 'build' function. It will be removed in a future
        release.

0.03  2006-07-04T22:35:42
      - Added ability to override the exported functions by subclassing
        Class::Meta::Express. See the new "Overriding Functions" section of
        the documentation.

0.02  2006-05-30T03:22:30
      - Documented that the 'reexport' parameter to meta() can take a code
        reference argument.
      - Fixed the 'reexport' parameter so that when it is a coderef it
        actually works.
      - Added POD coverage test.
      - Added README to MANIFEST (and therefore to distribution)

0.01  2006-05-30T00:56:44
      - Initial public release.
